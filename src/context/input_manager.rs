//! The `input_manager` module provides a struct for managing user input, including key presses, mouse buttons, and mouse position.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - `event-driven`: Uses the `glfw` crate to poll events from the window.
//! - `key-presses`: Tracks which keys are currently pressed and which were just pressed.
//! - `mouse-buttons`: Tracks which mouse buttons are currently pressed and which were just pressed.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! Use this within nodes behavior to have dynamic behavior based on user input.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```rust,ignore
//! impl Behavior for CustomNode {
//!     fn behavior(&mut self, context: &mut GameContext) {
//!         // print all the keys that were just pressed
//!         for key in context.input.key_just_pressed.iter() {
//!            println!("Key just pressed: {:?}", key);
//!        }
//! }
//! ```
