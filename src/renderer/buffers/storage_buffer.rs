//! Storage buffers help create and write to buffers on the gpu
//!
//! Storage Buffers are like uniforms on the gpu except they can store up to 128MB of data with
//! some gpus with greater storage. they can also be written to. while a cpu can read info on the
//! buffer its highly discouraged
